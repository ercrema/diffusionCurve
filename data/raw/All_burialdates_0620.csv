Ol.18.45WProject manager: G Hey (Oxford Archaeology), 1991, 1992, and 1996Archival body: Oxfordshire County Museum ServiceDescription: a widespread scatter of pits across the Yarnton landscape; three have been dated to the late Neolithic and Beaker periods. This included one on the second gravel terrace on theYarnton, Worton Rectory Farm site, one on floodplain site 3, and one in an alignment of eight pits running north-east to south-west in the north-west corner of site 7.Objectives: to establish the longevity of the practice of formalised deposition within pits across the landscape, assess how the materials placed within these pits changed through time, and to show how the pit alignment fitted into the developing framework of settlement and specialised activity on the floodplain.Final comment: G Hey (28 November 2012), the dates span the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age and demonstrate the repeated use of the Yarnton floodplain and adjacent gravel terrace over this period of time, and the range of deposits that were placed within pits (cremated animals and humans and charred wild foods).Laboratory comment: English Heritage (19 June 2014), five further samples were submitted for dating prior to 1998 and were published in Bayliss et al (2015, 251- 3; OxA-4663- 5,-6619, and -6774).References:  Bayliss et al 2015 Hey et al forthcomingOxA-12040 3645 ?28 BP{i""C: -23.3 ?0.2%0Sample:YFPB96 4438 <5171>, submitted in October 2002 by C ChissellMaterial: charcoal: Quercus sp., sapwood (<2g) (M Robinson 2002)Initial comment: sample 5172 derived from cremation deposit4439, and sample 5171 derived from the upper fill 4438, both within pit 4437. This pit formed part of a south-west to north-east pit alignment in the north-west corner of the site.Objectives: this feature contains cremation deposit found on this part of the floodplain totalling over 2600g of calcined human bone. It is also one of only three large deposits consisting entirely of human bone as opposed to mixed human and animal bone.

A section was also excavated across a palaeochannel which ran on the south edge of the site. It had its origins in the Devensian but its most intensive use was associated with dumps of wood debris and wooden structures, believed to be associated with the occupation site.':\IQObjectives: to date the sequence found within the channel in order to understand its relationship to the Bronze Age settlement and other activity at Yarnton, and provide a better chronology of landscape change in this area throughout the Holocene.Final comment: A Bayliss and G Hey (28 November 2012), inorganic sediment filling the early Holocene channel to the south of site 1 on the Yarnton floodplain yielded a small wooden revetment on the south side of the channel (structure 116), which is dated to 800-760 cal BC (95% probability; UB-4062), on the basis of the later of two posts (W125 and W126) sampled from this structure. The other post (Wl 26) produced a late Neolithic/early Bronze Age date (UB-4061) and must be reused in this context.However, its presence indicates that the water level in the channel was sufficiently high at the end of the third millennium ea!

Ol.18.45WProject manager: G Hey (Oxford Archaeology), 1998Archival body: Oxfordshire County Museums ServiceDescription: features uncovered on site 21 revealed a variety of activity taking place during the early Bronze Age. A waterhole, 15014, was dug into the base of the channel and must pre-date the reactivation of this channel. An important deposit of worked wood was dumped into the top of the waterhole after it went out of use, which included a log ladder and a wooden bowl, both made of alder. North of the waterhole was a spread of burnt stone and a pit packed with burnt stone and charcoal. Another waterhole, 15072, was dug on the bank of the channel. A waterhole, 10159, a square-sided pit filled with burnt stone and charcoal, 10022, and spreads of burnt stone were found on the north bank of a palaeochannel on site 17.Objectives: the objectives in dating this sequence of samples were to place the activity within the overall chronology of settlement at Yarnton, to date the first use of the areas on which these sites were set, to date a series of unusual artefacts, to date important changes in the surrounding vegetation and the rising water table that occurred in the middle Bronze Age.Final comment: G Hey (28 November 2012), activity on site 17 probably began in the fifteenth century ea!

Ol.18.45WProject manager: G Hey (Oxford Archaeological Unit),1990- 6Description: the Oxford Archaeological Unit excavated a series of sites and landscape features of Saxon and medieval date in the ARC Cassington Pit, in the parishes ofYarnton and Cassington between 1990 and 1996. Saxon settlement was found on the three sites on the higher gravel terrace, at Yarnton, Cresswell Field,Yarnton, and at Worton. At Yarnton, small-scale settlement of earlier Saxon date comprised sunken-featured buildings with associated pits and one possible post-built structure which suggested a shifting settlement pattern. This was replaced in the late-seventh or early-eighth century AD by occupation with avariety of structure types (timber hall buildings, sunken?_ featured buildings, a possible granary, and dovecote) organised within a defined area with enclosures, fences, tracks, and paddocks. This settlement appears to have been occupied into the later Saxon period. Only 500m west of the Yarnton middle Saxon settlement, in Cresswell Field, a Saxon timber hall, several sunken-featured buildings, pits, and fencelines were located amongst the features of a densely-occupied Iron Age site. Excavation at Worton, 1.5km west ofYarnton along the gravel terrace, has been much more small-scale and is largely based on evaluation evidence, but elements of early Saxon settlement in the form of sunken-featured buildings and pottery, and middle Saxon settlement (a post-in-trench building) have been found.Objectives: The main objectives of the excavations were to:investigate the period of transition from the late Roman to the Saxon period; 2. understand the choice of Saxon settlement location, its development and changing settlement patterns, and comparing contemporary adjacent sites. Extensive investigation rather than detailed excavation was used to examine these aspects of the archaeological record; 3. reconstruct the landscape in which these settlements were established, understand changing land use strategies from the end of the Roman into the medieval period and assess human impact on the environment.The chronological relationships of different elements of the settlements and landscape were of critical importance in this context, especially given the paucity of pottery and other datable artefacts.shaped enclosure.OxA-8807 3815 ?40 BP811G: -21.1%0815N (diet): +10.3%0GIN ratio: 3.4Sample: YCF95 8784, submitted on 26 February 1999 by C BellMaterial: human bone (right radius) (A Boyle)Initial comment: from an adult inhumation, skeleton 8784 from grave 8785 .

Ol.18.45WProject manager: G Hey (Oxford Archaeology), 1991, 1992, and 1996Archival body: Oxfordshire County Museum ServiceDescription: a widespread scatter of pits across the Yarnton landscape; three have been dated to the late Neolithic and Beaker periods. This included one on the second gravel terrace on theYarnton, Worton Rectory Farm site, one on floodplain site 3, and one in an alignment of eight pits running north-east to south-west in the north-west corner of site 7.Objectives: to establish the longevity of the practice of formalised deposition within pits across the landscape, assess how the materials placed within these pits changed through time, and to show how the pit alignment fitted into the developing framework of settlement and specialised activity on the floodplain.Final comment: G Hey (28 November 2012), the dates span the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age and demonstrate the repeated use of the Yarnton floodplain and adjacent gravel terrace over this period of time, and the range of deposits that were placed within pits (cremated animals and humans and charred wild foods).Laboratory comment: English Heritage (19 June 2014), five further samples were submitted for dating prior to 1998 and were published in Bayliss et al (2015, 251- 3; OxA-4663- 5,-6619, and -6774).References:  Bayliss et al 2015 Hey et al forthcomingOxA-12040 3645 ?28 BP{i""C: -23.3 ?0.2%0Sample:YFPB96 4438 <5171>, submitted in October 2002 by C ChissellMaterial: charcoal: Quercus sp., sapwood (<2g) (M Robinson 2002)Initial comment: sample 5172 derived from cremation deposit4439, and sample 5171 derived from the upper fill 4438, both within pit 4437.
